# Final Lab Comp20

1. The purpose of this Git repository is for me to look back at 
	this code in 10 years and realize how terrible I was at 
	programming.

2. My favorite lab was the karaoke machine one because the song 
	is very catchy and it was my first exposure to JavaScript 
	being asynchronous.

3. I grew a lot in terms of understanding the web's architecture as 
	well as getting experience on real, applicable projects!

4. The most important thing that I learned in this course was nothing 
	concrete like learning a programming language but it was more 
	about paying attention to the small things and learning about 
	what I can do with the skills I learn in class. We spend our 
	time learning things in class but never really how to apply them.
	I think this course does a good job, with assignments such as the 
	final project and assignments 2-4, at applying the knowledge aquired 
	in class.

5. I think I want to try out web security as well as project management.
	This may sound strange but the fourth assignment and the final 
	project helped me understand how crucial both of those things are 
	and why they matter.
